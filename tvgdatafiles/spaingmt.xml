    <desc lang="en">Wales v France (Kick-off 8.00pm). John Inverdale introduces coverage from the Millennium Stadium, where the third round of fixtures gets under way. Wales are looking to get back on track after being comprehensively outplayed by Ireland in their last match, while France have won at home to England and Italy so far. This is a clash with an intriguing sub-plot. Many of French rugby's woes have been blamed on the influx of foreign players into the cash-rich Top 14 league, of which Wales have provided several, while Welsh rugby's major problem is how to keep hold of their players to strengthen the domestic regions. Les Bleus suffered the ignominy of ending last season at the bottom of the table, which was the start of a dismal 2013 that saw them win just two matches all year, and heaped considerable pressure on coach Philippe Saint-Andre, although they traditionally prosper in years following British &amp; Irish Lions' tours and another win here would move them closer to the Grand Slam.

With the fear of invasion gripping the country, even Boy Scouts were engaged to help guard bridges, and for the first time British civilians were bombed from the air and fired on by enemy ships.

Gold medals were awarded in curling, figure skating, freestyle skiing, Nordic Combined skiing and ice hockey, with the figure skating and Nordic Combined coming to a conclusion at these Games. Today saw the first finals in the Games' two ongoing team sports - the curling and ice hockey - and in both cases it was the women who were involved. The ice hockey at the Bolshoy Ice Dome in Sochi saw the nations aiming to emulate the achievements of Canada, who won gold four years ago on home soil to continue their dominance of the Games, having been victorious on three of the four occasions since women's ice hockey was given official Olympic recognition. Three of the finals have been between Canada and the USA, with Sweden and Finland being the only other nations to have won medals in the women's event</desc>

Giuliano Razzoli of Italy won the gold medal four years ago in Canada, with the dramatic second run taking place in rain, providing enough problems to force the course to be shortened and the times in the concluding run to be considerably slower than in the first.

    <desc lang="en">The three petrolheads demonstrate their love of small cars with a trip to Ukraine. Jeremy Clarkson chooses a Volkswagen Up for the journey, while Richard Hammond takes a Ford Fiesta and James May opts for a Dacia Sandero. On their adventure, the trio absorb the history of the Crimean Peninsula, including a visit to an old submarine pen - but the carefree exploration looks likely to become a chore when Jeremy, Richard and James are challenged to a long drive north through the expansive country, during which they must combat serious boredom. And as if that wasn't arduous enough, a new task is set when they arrive in Kiev - a trip into the wasteland of Chernobyl. This edition also features a track test of the Danish Zenvo ST1 supercar and James Blunt returns for another drive in the Reasonably Priced Car</desc>
