    <title lang="en">Jeopardy!</title>
    <desc lang="en">The classic thinking person's answer-and-question quiz, developed by Merv Griffin, first aired as an NBC daytime series in the 1960s, but its popularity really boomed in early-evening first-run syndication. `Jeopardy!' has also spawned offshoots, including the limited-run 1990 ABC series `Super Jeopardy!' (which featured champions from the syndicated show), and VH1's 1998 `Rock 'n' Roll Jeopardy!' (hosted by Jeff Probst)</desc>

In this hour, re-creations follow the onetime Roman soldier and 70 or so other escapees from a gladiator school. At first, this ragtag band “doesn't have much choice except to fight dirty,” says historian Crispin Swayne. But guerrilla victories swell his army to 100,000, and it will take Rome two years to stop him</desc>
