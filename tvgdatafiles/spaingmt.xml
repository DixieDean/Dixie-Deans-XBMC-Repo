Action from yesterday's ski jumping and figure skating follows at 8.00, with the women's ice hockey group fixture between Finland and Switzerland from 9.00 at the Shayba Arena in Sochi, and women's curling at 10.00 from the Ice Cube Curling Centre in Sochi, where the round-robin stage continues with the match between Great Britain and Canada. This represents a tough test for Eve Muirhead and her squad, with Canada finishing as runners-up four years ago after topping the standings during the round-robin phase.

Alex soon gets to the root of the family business's problem - 86-year-old Harry Pilgrim's refusal to let go of the reins has left son Mark frustrated in his role as general manager. Alex also believes the old-fashioned decor and unimaginative menu only attracts elderly clientele, so she sets about bringing the hotel into the 21st century. But can she persuade Mark to be more forceful as a leader?</desc>

Alex soon gets to the root of the family business's problem - 86-year-old Harry Pilgrim's refusal to let go of the reins has left son Mark frustrated in his role as general manager. Alex also believes the old-fashioned decor and unimaginative menu only attracts elderly clientele, so she sets about bringing the hotel into the 21st century. But can she persuade Mark to be more forceful as a leader?</desc>
