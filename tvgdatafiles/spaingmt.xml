    <title lang="en">Live Six Nations Rugby Union</title>
    <desc lang="en">Wales v Italy (Kick-off 2.30pm). Jason Mohammad presents coverage of the opening match of the 2014 championship, as Wales begin their quest for a third successive title at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Their fans will remember 2013 as a banner year for Welsh rugby, as they not only sealed last year's Six Nations with a comprehensive victory at home to England in the final match, but coach Warren Gatland led a Lions squad containing a large Welsh contingent to victory on their tour of Australia. Gatland missed the entire Six Nations campaign last year while he continued his rehabilitation from two broken heels suffered while on holiday, leaving assistant coach Robert Howley to lead the nation in his absence, but the New Zealander returns for this match looking to continue Wales' excellent record of never having lost at home to the Azzurri. With commentary by Andrew Cotter and Jonathan Davies, and analysis from Martyn Williams and Shane Williams</desc>

    <title lang="en">Live Six Nations Rugby Union</title>
    <desc lang="en">France v England (Kick-off 5.00pm). John Inverdale is joined by Clive Woodward, Jeremy Guscott and Thomas Castaignede to present coverage of the second match of the opening weekend of the championship, which takes place at the Stade de France in Paris. While England suffered the disappointment of missing out on last year's title to Wales after losing their final match 30-3 in Cardiff, France suffered the ignominy of finishing at the foot of the table with just one win and one draw from their five matches, despite starting out as one of the favourites for victory. England will be buoyed by their recent record against Les Bleus coming into this contest, having won six of the last eight meetings between the two, including a 23-13 victory at Twickenham last year, as well as three of the last four matches at the French national stadium.
