    <desc lang="en">The glamorous Ruth Van Rydock contacts her old friend Jane Marple with a mystery - her sister Carrie Louise's study has been devastated by a suspicious fire. While Carrie Louise has the same cheerful outlook as ever, Ruth fears dark forces are at play at Stonygates, the home Carrie shares with her third husband, various relatives and a motley crew of young criminals, the latest subject of Carrie's philanthropic endeavours.
