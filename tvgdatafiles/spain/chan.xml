    <desc lang="en">The focus turns to Britain's public art collections, in which 17,000 paintings are listed as `artist unknown'. From these Philip Mould and his research director Bendor Grosvenor identify several works they believe are by Thomas Gainsborough. They choose two paintings, the first being an 18th-century portrait of St Albans mayor Joseph Gape that Bendor thinks dates back to the artist's days as a high-society portrait painter - although he'll need to convince the world's leading Gainsborough expert. Philip's choice is a rare landscape, painted when the artist was experimenting with dreamlike scenes. But why is conservationist Aviva Burnstock troubled by a distinctive blue pigment?

Alpine skiing, biathlon, freestyle skiing, short track speed skating and speed skating were the sports in which medals were won, with the women's super combined being the focus of attention at Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort. Germany's Maria Hoefl-Riesch won one of two gold medals in Vancouver four years ago in this discipline, and is still among the leading contenders in an event that requires outstanding ability in both downhill and slalom forms of the sport. Elsewhere, the biathlon continued at the Laura Biathlon &amp; Ski Complex near Krasnaya Polyana with another gruelling test, as the men took part in the 12.5km pursuit, which was won by Bjorn Ferry of Sweden four years ago</desc>

Meanwhile, James May spends time at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan to learn about the army's vehicle redeployment efforts, and Thor star Tom Hiddleston tries to coax the best time he can muster from the Reasonably Priced Car</desc>

It mixes news---from a religious perspective---with inspirational interviews with celebrities, along with Bible readings and entertainment. Conservative icon (and 1988 presidential candidate) Pat Robertson founded the hugely popular program from a 1963 fund-raising pledge effort on UHF TV in Virginia</desc>

Bob Barker racked up over a dozen hosting Emmys since CBS first aired the daytime staple in 1972, though it originated with Bill Cullen on NBC (1956-63) and ABC (1963-65). However, it was the genial, ageless Barker who really sold viewers on the show, which spawned several syndicated offshoots and a string of prime-time specials.
