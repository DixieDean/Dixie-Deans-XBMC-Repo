From these Philip Mould and his research director Bendor Grosvenor identify several works they believe are by Thomas Gainsborough. They choose two paintings, the first being an 18th-century portrait of St Albans mayor Joseph Gape that Bendor thinks dates back to the artist's days as a high-society portrait painter - although he'll need to convince the world's leading Gainsborough expert. Philip's choice is a rare landscape, painted when the artist was experimenting with dreamlike scenes. But why is conservationist Aviva Burnstock troubled by a distinctive blue pigment?

Over the course of several centuries, medieval musicians painstakingly put together the basics of what has become termed harmony and then added rhythm - the building blocks of the music the world enjoys today</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Clare Balding presents concluding coverage from the second day of the Games in Russia, featuring figure skating and luge from 5.10, and ski jumping from 6.30. The team figure skating concludes with the team free ice dance discipline at the Iceberg Skating Palace in Sochi, while the men's singles luge reaches a climax with the fourth run at the Sliding Centre Sanki near Krasnaya Polyana. Attention then switches to the first ski jumping medals to be decided at the RusSki Gorki Jumping Centre in Krasnaya Polyana, where the competitors take on the second and final jump in the men's individual Normal Hill event. The ski jumping medals in Vancouver were shared by five nations, but Simon Amman was the star of the Games, winning both this event and the Large Hill, although Switzerland finished outside the medals in the team discipline, which was won by Austria. This year's Games will also feature a women's jump, which takes place at this venue on Tuesday. Paul Dickenson and Colin Bryce are the commentators for the luge.

    <title lang="en">Winter Olympics</title>
    <desc lang="en">Clare Balding introduces highlights from day two in Russia, where eight gold medals were decided in venues in Sochi and Krasnaya Polyana. The alpine skiing was one of the sports to get under way today, as the men's downhill garnered much of the attention on the slopes at the Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort, while the inaugural women's snowboarding slopestyle champion was crowned at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park, and the women's ice hockey group match between Russia and Germany took place at the Shayba Arena in Sochi. The men's downhill is traditionally seen as the blue riband event of any Games, and Didier Defago of Switzerland won the gold medal four years ago in Vancouver, with Norway's Aksel Lund Svindal a close second and Bode Miller of the USA in third. Miller's medal helped his country to an outstanding haul of eight, twice as many as their nearest rivals Norway and Austria</desc>
